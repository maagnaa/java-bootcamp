## Section 1.4 Functions

Not a lot to be said about functions specifically for Java that is not intuitively similar to other languages.
However, some random notes/stuff I learned from workbooks

### Exiting a method with error

```java
  System.exit(status: 0);
```

### Sleeping
```java
try{
  Thread.sleep(150); // Time in ms
}
catch(InterruptedException e){
  System.out.println(e);  // Or some other handling of e
}
```

### Generating random numbers

#### Alternative 1
```java
  double randomNumber = Math.random*13;
  int randomIntNumber = (int)randomNumber;
```

In this example we want to obtain a random integer number between 0 and 13.
Math.random produces a random decimal value (double) between 0 and 1, so we multiply the result with 13 to scale the output of Math.random appropiately.
We then store the value as an integer by way of typecasting.

#### Alternative 2
```java
  import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;
```
```java
  int a = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(origin,bound);
```

In this example we generate a pseudorandom integer between the value of origin (inclusive) and bound (exclusive).
