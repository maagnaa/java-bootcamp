## 1.1 Getting Started

Goals of this section:

- Installing a JDK
- Running my first Java code


#### JDK - Java Development Toolkit

JDK stands for Java Development Toolkit and is the software development environment used to develop Java applications. 
It contains dev tools like the interpreter and compiler, as well as the JRE.
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment and it provides the environment that executes Java code as it is the implementation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

I am using [Amazon Corretto 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) for this bootcamp.

###### Compiling and running Java Code

- Compile:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *javac* class.java      
- Runtime:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *java* &nbsp; class           

Also, to check compiler and/or runtime version: *javac* -version / *java*  -version

#### Notes

- In Java, all code must be contained within a class.
- Every Java app needs a main method as an entry point, but not necessarily every class.
- Class name and corresponding file name must always match exactly.

###### Naming Conventions

- Classes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CamelCase
- Variables: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowerCamelCase
- Functions: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowerCamelCase
